# Technical exercise

Using open data, handling API queries and large datasets, and doing fast exploratory data analysis.

Moreover, building and evaluating models using tidymodels. Unfortunately using this dataset, accuracy and AUC were low, so not suitable for sharing as part of final products in this state. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Run `early_EDA.Rmd` to follow an exploratory process, with several steps that did not make it into the final product.

## Leaflet map

Run `leaflet-map.Rmd` to see the final product: a map of collisions, with different icons for different types of incidents. 

## Tidy models

To see how one may go about predictive modelling using this dataset, look in the `tidymodels-wip` folder. These models were not suitably accurate for inclusion in any final product. These scripts require that data from the other scripts is loaded.
